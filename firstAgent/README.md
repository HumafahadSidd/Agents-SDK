#Agent based on openai simple format 
# Open Router Pro - AI Story Writer Agent

A Python application that uses AI agents to generate stories through OpenRouter's API, leveraging various language models for creative writing tasks.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Story Generation**: Uses advanced language models to create stories based on user prompts
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Access to multiple AI models through OpenRouter's unified API
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Built with the `agents` framework for structured AI interactions
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Secure API key management using environment variables

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`
- OpenRouter API key
- Gemini API key (optional, for fallback)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd open_router_pro
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Using `uv` (recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

Or using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

## üîë API Keys Setup

### OpenRouter API Key
1. Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to your API keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### Gemini API Key (Optional)
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `GEMINI_API_KEY`

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

Or with explicit environment targeting:
```bash
uv run --active main.py
```

### Customizing the Agent
You can modify the agent's behavior by editing the `main.py` file:

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="Writer agent",
    instructions="you are a writer assistant.and write stories"
)
```

### Changing the Input
Modify the input prompt in `main.py`:
```python
response = Runner.run_sync(
    agent,
    input="your custom story prompt here",
    run_config=config
)
```

## ü§ñ Supported Models

The application currently supports various models through OpenRouter:

- **Mistral Small 3.2**: `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct:free`
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: `gemini-2.0-flash` (when using Gemini API directly)

You can change the model by modifying the `model` parameter in `main.py`:

```python
model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
    model="your-preferred-model-name",
    openai_client=external_client
)
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
open_router_pro/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml       # Project configuration and dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                # Environment variables (create this)
```

## üîß Configuration

### RunConfig Options
- `model`: The AI model to use
- `model_provider`: The client for API communication
- `tracing_disabled`: Disable tracing for performance

### Agent Configuration
- `name`: Agent identifier
- `instructions`: System prompt defining agent behavior

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Set Error**
   ```
   ValueError: GEMINI_API_KEY is not set
   ```
   - Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains the required API keys
   - Check that the key names match exactly

2. **Virtual Environment Warning**
   ```
   warning: VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv does not match the project environment path
   ```
   - Use `uv run --active main.py` to explicitly target the active environment
   - Or activate the correct virtual environment before running

3. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `uv sync`
   - Check that you're using the correct Python environment

### Environment Setup Issues
If you encounter environment-related problems:
```bash
# Deactivate any existing environments
deactivate

# Create and activate a new environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## üìö Dependencies

- **agents**: AI agent framework for structured interactions
- **litellm**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **AsyncOpenAI**: Async client for OpenAI-compatible APIs

**Happy Story Writing! üìñ‚ú®**

Ctrl+K to generate a command
It looks like you've shared your main.py file, which is set up to use an agent for story writing, and you've also included a terminal warning message:
Apply to main.py
##What this warning means
The warning is from the uv tool (a Python package/dependency manager).
It says that the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable is set to .venv, but your actual active environment is at C:\Users\kk\.venv.
As a result, uv will ignore .venv and use the active environment at C:\Users\kk\.venv.
This is just a warning and does not stop your script from running, but it may cause confusion if you expect to use a different virtual environment.
How to resolve or suppress this warning
Use the --active flag
When running your script, you can add --active to explicitly use the currently active environment:
Apply to main.py
Deactivate conflicting environments
Make sure you are only using one virtual environment. If you want to use .venv in your project folder, activate it:
Or, if you want to use the global one at C:\Users\kk\.venv, ensure .venv is not being referenced.
Unset the VIRTUAL_ENV variable
If you don't want to use .venv, you can unset the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable before running your script.
Does your code work?
If your script runs and prints a response, the warning can be ignored unless you specifically want to use a different environment. If you want to ensure you are using the correct dependencies, it's best to activate the intended virtual environment before running your script.
